## 2. Game Vision & Pillars

**Vision Statement:**
Rise from humble beginnings as a surf in a land of seven kingdoms. Build, manage, and expand your farm and village, survive oppressive tax cycles, and rally your people to revolt against your lords. Conquer one kingdom at a time, until you face the ultimate tyrant: the Dark Knight. Your choices—loyalty, rebellion, taxation—shape the fate of Everland.

**Core Pillars:**

* Village/Farm Management: Grow crops, gather resources, build structures, and expand your community.
* Tax, Tribute & Power: Survive recurring tax cycles, balance loyalty and risk, and climb the feudal ladder.
* Uprising & Conquest: Inspire rebellion, lead revolts, and overthrow your oppressors, kingdom by kingdom.
* Kingdom Progression: Each region offers unique biomes, resources, and increasing challenge.
* Ultimate Villain: Face the Dark Knight in a climactic final uprising.

## 3. Story & Setting

### Narrative Summary

In the divided land of Everland, seven kingdoms form a chain of feudal oppression. As a lowly surf, you tend your farm and pay crushing taxes to your local lord. As you grow your wealth, influence, and following, you rally fellow peasants and eventually rise up to seize the throne. Every kingdom conquered brings you closer to the true source of tyranny: the Dark Knight, whose castle casts a shadow over all.

### World Setting

* Seven distinct kingdoms, each a unique biome with its own resources, lords, and culture.
* Taxation and tribute form the backbone of the world and drive both narrative and strategy.
* Each kingdom’s castle is both a source of oppression (tax collectors, soldiers) and the key to conquest.
* Overthrowing one lord places you on the next rung: now you pay tax up the chain to ever more powerful rulers, culminating with the Dark Knight.

---

## 4. Gameplay & Mechanics

### 4.1 Exploration & Village Life

* Isometric movement, building placement, and direct interaction with the world.
* Start as a single farm; grow into a bustling village by attracting new NPCs and constructing homes, farms, mills, smithies, defenses, and more.
* Interact with villagers, manage morale, assign roles/jobs, and protect your people.

### 4.2 Farming & Resource Management

* Grow crops, raise animals, harvest wood, mine ore, and gather food.
* Store, trade, or convert resources to money or upgrades.
* Unique crops/resources per kingdom biome (incentivizes conquest and expansion).

### 4.3 Tax & Tribute Cycle

* Each season (or fixed interval), the local lord’s tax collector arrives.
* **Paying Tax:**

  * Maintains peace and security; the lord’s soldiers protect you from raiders.
  * Grants access to castle markets, advanced tech, and construction permits.
* **Defaulting/Refusing:**

  * Makes your village vulnerable to raids, higher crime, and natural consequences.
  * Repeated default leads to harsher punishments or threats from the lord.
* **Kingdom Tax Ladder:**

  * Each conquered kingdom requires you to pay tribute to the next ruler up the chain (ultimately the Dark Knight).

### 4.4 Raids, Threats & Defenses

* Random or triggered raiding parties attack your farm/village if unprotected.
* Build walls, traps, and train villagers for defense.
* Defend in real-time skirmishes, command squads, or fight directly (RPG mode optional).

### 4.5 Followers & Uprising Preparation

* Recruit and bond with villagers, craftspeople, and secret rebels.
* Increase morale, train fighters, gather secret resources, and plan revolts while hiding your intentions from the lord.
* Each uprising requires meeting certain thresholds: followers, supplies, weapons, and secret support.

### 4.6 Uprising & Castle Assault

* Once prepared, trigger a full-scale revolt.
* Lead your people in battle against the lord’s soldiers, breach the castle, and defeat the boss (lord or their champion).
* Victory makes you the new ruler of that kingdom.

### 4.7 Kingdom Progression & Power

* As lord, set your own tax rate, decide policies, and balance village growth with loyalty (or risk rebellion from below).
* Conquer the next kingdom: face new challenges, stronger lords, and unique biomes.
* Continue until you reach the Dark Knight’s domain.

### 4.8 Final Kingdom & The Dark Knight

* The last and hardest region: massive defenses, relentless tax cycle, and toughest enemies.
* Final revolt: unite all your previous kingdoms’ forces for a climactic battle.

### 4.9 Meta-Game & Replayability

* Multiple strategies: peaceful builder, ruthless tyrant, clever rebel.
* Dynamic events, random challenges, and different rebellion outcomes.
* NG+ modes and alternate endings based on your choices as both surf and lord.
