# Never Everland – Pitch Deck

## 1. High Concept

Never Everland is an isometric pixel-art action-adventure game inspired by Zelda: A Link to the Past, Stardew Valley, and Maniac Mansion. Players explore a vast, magical world set in the dark ages, customizing their hero, recruiting friends, and facing off against the evil Dark Knight and his legion of fortress bosses. The game blends classic dungeon-crawling, party-based puzzle-solving, farming/building, and a deep upgrade and quest system.

## 2. Vision Statement

Bring together the nostalgia and gameplay variety of classic SNES-era adventure games with the modern sensibilities of community, customization, and sandbox systems—Never Everland aims to create a magical world players love to get lost in, with meaningful choice and replayability.

## 3. Core Pillars

* Epic Adventure & Exploration: A handcrafted, interconnected world filled with secrets, challenges, and lore.
* Party-Based Puzzles & Combat: Unique friends/companions required for different puzzles and bosses.
* Customization & Growth: Character appearance, base-building, gear, and party upgrades.
* Farming, Harvesting, and Building: Meaningful systems for resource gathering and world-shaping.

## 4. Story Overview

The once-peaceful realm of Everland has fallen into darkness under the iron rule of the Evil Dark Knight. His minions control a network of castles and fortresses, each guarded by a powerful boss. The player, a young adventurer with a mysterious past, must recruit allies, free the land, and ultimately confront the Dark Knight himself.

* Act 1: The invasion begins. Player forms the first party, rescues their hometown, learns the world’s systems.

* Act 3: The final confrontation with the Dark Knight—requires mastery of all systems and teamwork.
